From organically grown grapes. Needs a year or two to soften.;Robert Parker's Wine Advocate,91,A certified organic wine  the 2017 Chianti Classico Riserva shows signs of the hot vintage with black and baked fruit. There is ample depth and richness  and this Riserva certainly embraces a full-bodied style  especially for Sangiovese (blended here with 5% Merlot and 5% Syrah). There is a hint of sweetness on the close  with some blackberry or cherry confit  but the bouquet is also framed by soft oak spice and smoke. This wine is probably best for near and medium-term drinking. Best After 2022

The harvest of 2016 delivered fruity but very serious wines. It’s dark in color  with very complex aromatic profile  ripe red fruits  blackberries and dark cherry. Fresh on the mouth  with serious but round tannins  and a toasted note in complement to the fruit. The finish is long and complex  telling us that cellaring this wine a few more years will be a good decision. However we shouldn't lose the opportunity to enjoy it also right now  with all its irreverent youth coming through the glass.|Wine Enthusiast,94,This is a rich  impressively dense wine. This vintage is exceptional with its poise between richness and opulent black fruits. With its tannins and great concentration  it is just approaching readiness. Preferably wait until late 2020 to drink.;Wine Spectator,93,A vibrant medley of cherry tart and raspberry reduction flavors marks this powerful but charming red  with accents of licorice and floral. Dusty tannins meld over the mineral and bergamot tea notes on the finish. Best from 2020 through 2028.;Robert Parker's Wine Advocate,90,The 2016 Grande Reserva is mostly a 60/30 blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz  with 10% Touriga Franca  aged for 14 months in new French oak. It comes in at 14% alcohol. Despite lower alcohol  in perception  this adds extra concentration compared to the regular Reserva  plus more power. The tannins are rather ripe  though. The easygoing Reserva is ready now  but the Grande Reserva might benefit from a year or two in the cellar. Still  this is not a great Grande Reserva this issue. Like the Reserva  it is a bit understated. Also like the Reserva  it is wonderfully fresh and easy to drink with food  a very elegant wine.

The characteristic leather and sandalwood savory notes back up the fruit  along with some pretty purple flower aromas of violet and wisteria. In the glass  the densityand richness of the wine is apparent  and the mouth delivers that promise  withblackberry pie framed by white pepper and cedar  along with a touch of grilled meat adding a wild element to the flavors. Firm but round tannins carry the juicy fruit and dusky spice to a lengthy finish. Grilled meats come to mind first as excellent matches  such as spare ribs  grilled lamb  or Carolina pulled pork. A tangy and creamy cheese brings out the sweet fruit and texture of the wine beautifully. We love a goat Gouda  Bellwether’s Pepato  and a mild Camembert.|Wine & Spirits,95,This grows on three acres of syrah at the top of a south- facing ridge  where the vines ripen their fruit in an otherwise cool spot for the variety in western Green Valley  above the northern reaches of the Petaluma Gap. It was the last fruit Dan Goldfield harvested in 2016  which he then destemmed and left for a five-day cold soak before fermenting it in small open- top vats. Over the course of 23 months in oak barrels (40 percent new)  the wine developed layers of darkness and light—the cool feel of a coastal forest (think Armstrong Woods). For now  it has the fragrant restraint and tension of a far-coast pinot noir  with a deeper syrah tone to its damson plum fruit. That inner tension will sustain its freshness as the wine develops with age.;Wine Enthusiast,93,From a site on the western edges of the appellation  this wine spent 23 months in French oak  40% of it new. Baked plum  raspberry and blueberry fruit match a core of gamy intensity and elements of iron  leather and violet  the texture layered and thick.;Wine Spectator,92,Deeply structured yet retains finesse  offering smoked meat  blueberry and grilled sweet anise flavors that build tension toward medium-grained tannins. Best from 2023 through 2030.

This is a classic Etna red that can be stretched out to a 10-year drinking window if desired  although there's no reason not to enjoy this bottle straight out of the gate.;Vinous,90,As if you can smell the ashen volcanic soils that these vines grow in  the 2018 Nerello Mascalese Eruzione 1614 wafts up smoky and musky  with a complement of cherry and dried strawberry that fully completes the experience. This is soft and fleshy in feel  boasting a noticeable inner sweetness nicely balanced by brisk acids and pretty inner florals. The 2018 lacks the persistence and structure to promote long-term cellaring  but makes up for it with sheer drink ability.

Drink from 2022.  Editors' Choice. ;Robert Parker's Wine Advocate,93,The 2016 Reserva Old Vines (an average age of 70 years) represents 37 of Crasto's 42 plots and/or small vineyards of old vines.

It was aged for 16 to 18 months  depending on lot  in 65% new oak (85/15 French and American) and comes in at 14.5% alcohol. Solid in the mid-palate  this has impressive depth and a seductive demeanor. The finish lingers beautifully. After an initial creamy hit of texture  it becomes silkier and sensual. Beautifully balanced  this has moderate tannins. It drank well after some hours of double decanting  but it is not really ready to drink. It will be much better around 2023  although it is approachable. How does it compare to the 2015 revisited this issue? They weren't really tasted together  although in relatively close proximity. The 2015 may have better-defined fruit. This might have a little more depth. They are both very fine and a lot of fun. They both need to develop some complexity. It will take a few years to determine who the winner is for sure. I lean to the 2015  but let's call it even for the moment.

It has been seen before  when it seemed very fresh. It is mostly Baga (50%)  with about 25% each of Moreto and Castelão (a dramatic change from the last stats I was given). This bottle is still impressive. It is very lush for a Baga-dominated blend  but the Baga provides typical earthiness and amber while the other grapes in the blend add a little flavor. Enlivening  its big acidity results in a juicy finish. Then  the tannins take over. The structure is somewhat better than the concentration  but there's enough. This is in many respects still a baby  if a rather rustic one. It will easily last another 15 to 20 years.

About 15% (a deliberate increase from what used to be a nominal 5%) of the blend was aged in second use French oak for six months  the rest in tank. Crasto's idea with the increase in oak going forward is to change the wine's texture a bit and add a bit of gravitas. This has come together really well since last seen  fleshing out  showing a bit more power and (most importantly) vivid flavor. I'm not sure if this will hold serve throughout its useful life  but at the moment  it is worth leaning up on this succulent but fresh Tinto. It comes in at 14% alcohol.

It matured in underground and buried 2 600-liter clay tinajas (amphorae) for five months. It has 13% alcohol and a pH of 3.4  which speaks of its great freshness. It has a pale and bright ruby color  and it's medium-bodied  perfumed and fresh.

From a hot and dry vintage  the 2012 Taurasi Pago dei Fusi is beautifully aged and drinking very nicely at the moment. I see no need to wait further. The bouquet revolves around dried cherry and plum  and there are integrated notes of savory smoke and spice. The wine's advanced evolution shows with campfire ash and licorice root  and it would be a nice accompaniment to a Neapolitan "è braciol a’ raù" (meat braciole in a ragù).

There is great finesse and elegance here  in the winery's modern style with a lively palate and great acidity. This is produced with grapes from a vineyard planted in the 1970s that is almost 15 hectares  and it basically goes to this wine. The vineyard is vinified in seven different plots  and since 2013  when they harvested early and did a softer vinification  it has gained in precision  in a way  this 2016 could be the modern version of that 2013.

The bouquet is quite opulent  although there is a note of worn leather or cured meat that you notice straight off. This points to the more evolved state of this cooler vintage with fruit picked eight years ago. Those warm savory tones segue to baked fruit and dried blackberry. The wine finishes long with hints of sweetness and smoky spice. The overall effect is one of intensity and boldness. The wine is great now  but I'm concerned that those leathery and animal notes could worsen with time. I have shortened the drinking window as a result.

Full body  firm and silky tannins and a serious finish. Extremely polished and structured. Selection of the best cabernet from this farm.;Robert Parker's Wine Advocate,94,A wine that is stands apart from the single vineyard bottling  the 2013 Finca Los Membrillos is sourced from a vineyard planted with Cabernet Sauvignon. There are quince trees in the estate and they give the name to the wine (membrillo is the Spanish word for quince). This is a plot bordering Altamira that was planted with Cabernet when they bought it. They have now also planted Malbec and Cabernet Franc  so this wine will change in the future. They won't bottle the 2014 and 2015 vintages that were not good years for Cabernet in Mendoza. It's not easy to detect the grape here anyway. I see more similarities with the Canal Uco bottling to which Sebastian Zuccardi responded that the soils are very similar. The wine has very good freshness with fine tannins coating a fine thread of lively acidity. They have four different types of soils here and they used three for this wine. When the soils are very shallow the Cabernet has a tendency to dry out and the tannins can feel a bit harsh  so they need to find good balance using deeper soils to obtain these buttery tannins with the variety. The oak is a lot more noticeable since they use more new oak with the Cabernet than with Malbec. It has classic aromas of the oak-aged Cabernet  quite different from the Malbecs  mint  damsons  blackberries  something earthy  graphite even  cigar box and spices  and with the telltale tannins of the variety where the earthiness is more pronounced. This will be better with a little bit of time in bottle.;Wine Spectator,92,This boasts mouthfilling richness  with elegant and well-structured flavors of dried cherry  boysenberry and red currant.

Very graceful  this is reasonably concentrated and nicely structured  but it doesn't seem overly deep or powerful. It does seem refined and sophisticated  with a velvety finish.  This is a little too young just now  but it should continue to improve. It seems likely to be accessible very young  but it should hold reasonably well too. Joao Portugal Ramos said he thought it was more concentrated than some of the big vintages in the past  but it is not showing that now. Rating: 90+

This deep  medium to full-bodied  concentrated effort has ripe  polished tannins  a great mid-palate  and a blockbuster of a finish. It's as good as the 2015  it not even better! Give bottles another 2-3 years  count yourself lucky  and enjoy over the following 15+. Rating: 95+;Wine & Spirits,95,This comes from the vineyard that gave St-Joseph its name  a south-facing parcel of granite in Tournon that grew a garnet-hued beauty in 2017. It’s appealing from the very first whiff  a mix of oak smoke and spicy black plum. While the oak notes from two years in barrels are prominent  the wine feels balanced  the meaty fruit absorbing their impact without losing any of its freshness. You could drink this now for the sexy opulence of its bacon-smoked flavors  but it’s structured to age for a decade or more.;Wine Spectator,93,An extroverted style  with a rush of boldly ripe plum and blackberry compote flavors that are round and inviting in feel  laced with dark licorice and fruitcake and ending with an inlay of violet on the toasty finish. A buried iron note keeps it all honest.

Full-bodied and velvety  this is a rich  ripe Syrah that's presently hiding much of its granite terroir behind pillows of fruit and oak—but that sense of structure and proportion does shine through on the long  elegant finish. There's enough concentration and tannin to think at least a decade of aging potential is realistic.
