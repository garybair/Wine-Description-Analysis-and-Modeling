https://www.wine.com/product/domaine-du-terme-gigondas-2019/788314|Domaine du Terme Gigondas 2019|Rhone Red Blends| from Gigondas, Rhone, France|Red Wine||Spectacular Gigondas, this wine’s red-cherry flavors soar on an arc of cool, fresh acidity. A grounding of garrigue and ferrous minerality tethers the wine to the earth, gives it a sense of continuity and quiet power, but the overall impression is of fruit at moment of peak ripeness, preserved with crystal clarity. It’s made by Anne-Marie Gaudin, who farms 27 acres in Gigondas, the vines around 45 years old and grown without any chemical inputs. Straight from the first sniff it's clear this is going to be special. Soaring violets, plum flesh and blueberry, this is rounded and sweetly juicy with well-worked tannins that are present but fine and well melded into the fruit. Not the longest finish, but this is a great vintage for du Terme. Good value. 45-year-old vines on average, 80% destemmed, long fermentation and long élevage.

Vinous and red fruited, of the six 2018s from Eden Rift, this may be the most structured, showing a rosy scent at a distance, and dried cherry and strawberry flavors. There’s much in place but it needs time.

The wine offers aromas of raspberry and cherry, plum, blackberry and cassis, as well as cassis and violet. Firm in structure and velvety on the palate. This wine is characterized by its balance of alcohol and acidity, with some mineral flavors such as graphite.|One of the most encouraging qualities of those Chilean wines which made it through to gold and platinum this year, our judges felt, was a new aromatic complexity and a much finer understanding of aromatic maturity in the vineyard than in the past. This complex, subtle and still youthful blend offers an excellent example of this. It's dark black-red, with creamy plum and currant notes as well as a hint of fragrant, cured Havana leaf. On the palate, it is concentrated and long, with admirable freshness lending life and energy to the red and black fruits. Meaty yet supple tannins bring ballast. It's harmonious and accessible now, but there is enough density here to carry it effortlessly through half a decade's maturation.
