      "https://www.wine.com/product/domaine-du-terme-gigondas-2019/788314|Domaine du Terme Gigondas 2019|Rhone Red Blends| from Gigondas, Rhone, France|Red Wine||Spectacular Gigondas, this wines red-cherry flavors soar on an arc of cool, fresh acidity. A grounding of garrigue and ferrous minerality tethers the wine to the earth, gives it a sense of continuity and quiet power, but the overall impression is of fruit at moment of peak ripeness, preserved with crystal clarity. Its made by Anne-Marie Gaudin, who farms 27 acres in Gigondas, the vines around 45 years old and grown without any chemical inputs. Straight from the first sniff it's clear this is going to be special. Soaring violets, plum flesh and blueberry, this is rounded and sweetly juicy with well-worked tannins that are present but fine and well melded into the fruit. Not the longest finish, but this is a great vintage for du Terme. Good value. 45-year-old vines on average, 80% destemmed, long fermentation and long élevage.\n",
